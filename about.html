          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages - every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at - displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. - you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

          <h3>React</h3>
          <p>
            React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple
            views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently
            update and render just the right components when your data changes.
            Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to
            debug.

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            Coding is something that makes a difference. When you code, you get
            this feeling that you are helping people. Through code you can
            create something that people interact with, use, touch and work
            with. When you manage to build something that solves problems, you
            know that you are making a difference in someone else's life. That
            is an amazing feeling.
